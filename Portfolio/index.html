        <p>Hello, I'm Muhammad Talha, an undergraduate student currently in my 6th semester. I have a strong passion for the fascinating world of AI and cyber security. Exploring the depths of artificial intelligence and its applications to enhance security measures has always intrigued me.
          With a solid foundation in programming languages like Python, Chisel, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and some knowledge of C, I enjoy leveraging these skills to develop innovative solutions and tackle complex challenges. My enthusiasm for AI and cyber security drives me to continuously learn and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in these fields.
          I believe in the power of technology to shape a safer and more intelligent future. As an aspiring professional, I am keen to contribute to the development of secure AI systems and help build robust defenses against emerging cyber threats.        
          I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of AI and cyber security. Let's explore the possibilities together</p>
